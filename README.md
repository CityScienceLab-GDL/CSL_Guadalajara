Fear prevents the use of public spaces which can be attributed to the way cities are perceived and designed. Although there is a certain component of spatial determinism, it is ultimately defined by the relationship between the physical configuration of the space and the social use made of it as well as a confluence of political, economical and behavioural factors.  

In the search to determine the patterns that highlights fear perception in public spaces, it is proposed as initial approach a mechanism to construct composite indicators, using multi-criteria analysis and ranked weights, which is based in the scrutiny of literature linked to safer and more inclusive spaces between 1980 and 2020 with three different approaches; (1) environmental crimonology, system analysis and behavioural sciences, (2) urban planning and (3) architecture and social sciences. A branch of this last one addresses gender mainstreaming as a positive approach to cope with current global urban challenges, such as rapid urbanisation and migration.

Since quantification and numerical data are not enough to understand this reality, it has been essential evaluating the indicators from the proximity of the community scale thus the quality and accuracy of these indicators have been evolved with the feedback on the empirical processes, from focus groups workshops to in-depth personal interviews with women involved in the specific community of study, checking whether the set of individual indicators based on the academic papers is sufficient or appropriate to describe the phenomenon. 

### Since the perception of insecurity is completly linked to the person, depending on how familar you are with the context or how much you have normalized certain types of violence, the model aims not to lose the proximity when both understanding the phenomenon and conveying the results. Consequently, the simulation works with the indicators described and shows the perception of insecurity of each of the agents depending on how they interact with each other and with these variables in the specific context of Lomas del Centinela, Guadalajara.
